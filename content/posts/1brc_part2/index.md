description: Tackling the well-known "The One Billion Row Challange" in Rust, and optimizing it for maximum performance. Part 1 will only focus on single threaded performance
summary: |
  ["The One Billion Row Challenge"](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) is a programming challenge orignally written for Java, where the goal is to summarize a billion rows of temprature measurements as fast as possible. But since its invention, it has been solved in many other languages. In this blog post I will tackle the challenge myself and try to make my solution as fast as possible using Rust using a single thread, and in the next post I will use multiple threads to make it even faster.
